# Part 1: The Fibonacci Sequence

## What is it?
The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of th two preceding ones

For example the first two numbers are `0` and `1`, adding these together gives us `1`. This means our sequence is now `0,1,1`, so to get the next number we simply add `1` and `1` which gives us `2`. The sequence then grows in size very quickly...

The first 20 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence...

`0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89,144,233,377,610,987,1597,2584,4181`

## The task

- Write a program that returns the `nth` number of the Fibonacci sequence

## Example

- You are given a value of `N` to be `5`
- This means return the 5th number in the Fibonacci sequence
- This is actually **5** (we don't count 0 as the first)

## Example 2

- We now need to find the 21st number of the Fibonacci sequence
- We know the 19th and 20th number from the list above (2584 and 4181)
- So we can simply add these together to get the 21st (6765)
