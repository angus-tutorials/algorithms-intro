# Introduction to Algorithms in Python

Welcome to the algorithms introduction repository! This repo is designed to provide a fun introduction into solving some problems using Python

## A Word of Encouragement

Before you dive into the problems, we want to remind you that learning algorithms can be challenging, but also incredibly rewarding. These problems are not trivial, and it's completely normal to find them difficult at first. Don't be disheartened if you don't get everything right away. Remember, perseverance is key in learning and mastering new concepts. We encourage you to approach these problems with curiosity and patience.


The repository contains 3 packages that each contain a unique problem to solve, the problems get progressively harder in this order...

1. Fibonacci
2. Surveys
3. Meetings


## Overview of the packages

### 1. Fibonacci Sequence (Package: `fibonacci`)
The first package is a problem related to implementing the fibonacci sequence

#### Contents
- **`README.md`**: Explains the Fibonacci sequence and the task
- **`your_solution.py`**: A template file for you to write your Fibonacci sequence implementation.
- **`test_fibonacci.py`**: A set of tests to validate your Fibonacci sequence implementation.


### 2. Surveys (Package: `surveys`)
The second package is a problem related to an incident on a fictional development team caused by a fictional developer Paula ðŸ‘€

#### Contents
- **`README.md`**: Explains what happened and outlines the requirements of the task
- **`your_solution.py`**: A template file for you to write your solution in
- **`test_surveys.py`**: A set of tests to validate your implementation

### 3. Meetings (Package: `meetings`)
The final package is a problem related to Nick's calendar (Nick is a fictional member of a software development team)

#### Contents
- **`README.md`**: Explains the requirements of the task (including illustrations for guidance)
- **`your_solution.py`**: A template file for you to write your solution in
- **`test_meetings.py`**: A set of tests to validate your implementation
- **`plot.py`**: A simple script to plot the test data (to help visualise the problem)
